Description: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) excels at exploring cellular heterogeneity but loses spatial information for cells in solid issues, whereas bulk spatial transcriptomics (ST) methods detect expression spatial architecture but lack single-cell resolution. The R package BayesEATS, which is designed for commonly used operating systems including Windows, Linux and Mac OS, implements a method named BEATS to cluster cells, partition spatial spots into different regions, and obtain cellular enrichments of spots simultaneously. The method BEATS is a Bayesian statistical method that can help biologists discover deeper information on the internal structure of tissues by integrating the information of scRNA-seq data and bulk ST data. Package BayesEATS employs a hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to perform posterior inference for BEATS.
